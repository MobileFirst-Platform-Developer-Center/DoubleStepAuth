### Double-step adapter authentication
Double-step means that after the initial authentication that uses, for example, a username and a password, an additional authentication step is required, such as a login pin, a secret word, or similar identification. In this example, a secret word is implemented for the second authentication step. This sample application is based on the existing adapter-based authentication sample. The changes extend the application from single-step to double-step.
